Section 3.3.3, you may transfer copies of the SDK installed on one
of your computers to another one of your computers provided that

AIR&reg;&rdquo; is a trademark of Adobe that may not be used by
others except under a written license from Adobe. You may not
incorporate the Adobe AIR trademark, or any other Adobe trademark,

&ldquo;for Adobe&reg; AIR&reg;.&rdquo; You may use the Adobe
AIR trademark to refer to your Developer Program as an
&ldquo;Adobe&reg; AIR&reg; application&rdquo; only as a
